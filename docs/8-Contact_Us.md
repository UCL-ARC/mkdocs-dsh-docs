## MyServices

You can also contact us in MyServices creating aÂ [Data Safe Haven - General DSH Enquiry](https://myservices.ucl.ac.uk/self-service/requests/new/provide_description?from=wizard&requested_for_id=187535&requestor_id=187535&service_id=1473&service_instance_id=3892&subject=Data+Safe+Haven+-+General+DSH+Enquiry%3A&template_id=3222)

Please, add as much detail as you can about your request. 

## Drop-In Sessions

Research IT Services holds drop-in sessions roughly every two weeks which at least one member of the Research Computing team usually attends. More details and dates for these sessions are available on the [the RITS pages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it/research-it-data-management-drop-ins).

If you have a particularly complex problem, it may be useful to email the support address, <rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>, beforehand so that the person attending can prepare.

## Location

The Research Computing Team are located at:

> 38-50 Bidborough Street
> Floor 3
> London
> WC1H 9BT

We are keen to collaborate and welcome visitors to our offices to talk about all things research computing.
However, we do not operate a walk-up service desk: if you are frustrated by slow response to a support ticket, we are sorry but please do send reminders as there is probably a good reason why your request is not being processed.
