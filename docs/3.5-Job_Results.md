# Job Results
## Where do my results go?

After submitting your job to the DSH HPC Cluster, you can use the command `qstat` to view the status of all the jobs you have submitted. Once you can no longer see your job on the list, this means your job has completed. After a job is completed, you can see some technical statistics about it using the command `qacct -j <job-ID>`.

## Output and error files

When writing your job script you can either tell it to start in the directory you submit it from (`-cwd`), from a particular directory (`-wd <dir>`), or from your home directory (the default). When your job runs, it will create files in this working directory for the job's output and errors:

| File Name | Contents |
|:----------|:---------|
| `myscript.sh` | Your job script. |
| `myscript.sh.o12345` | Output from the job. (`stdout`) |
| `myscript.sh.e12345`  | Errors, warnings, and other messages from the job that aren't mixed into the output. (`stderr`) |

If you change the name of the job in the queue, using the `-N` option, your output and error files will use that as the filename stem instead.
Most programs will also produce *separate* output files, in a way that is particular to that program. Often these will be in the same directory, but that depends on the program and how you ran it.
