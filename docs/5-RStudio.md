# RStudio

The DSH HPC Cluster login nodes (and some select other DSH HPC machines) provide an RStudio service with graphical interface.

## Access

To access the service, visit the machine's URL from inside DSH. For the DSH HPC Cluster, this is: <https://cluster.idhs.ucl.ac.uk/rstudio/auth-sign-in>

You will be prompted to login with your DSH userid and password.

These RStudio instances and all of their components are only accessible from inside DSH network. 

### R session not starting or RStudio Initialisation Error

If you get an RStudio error pop-up: `Initialisation Error: Unable to connect to service` or an ever-spinning loading screen please, [get in touch with RC support](8-Contact_Us.md).
