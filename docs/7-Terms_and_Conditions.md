# Terms and Conditions

All use of Research Computing Platforms including DSH cluster are subject to the general [UCL Computing Regulations](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/sites/information_security/files/regulations.pdf).

DSH services are also subjected to the [Information Governance procedure and rationale](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/data-safe-haven-arc-trusted-research-environment-assurance) policy and the [UCL Information Security Management System (ISMS) policies for Trusted Research Environments] (https://isms.arc.ucl.ac.uk/) policy.


## Commercial Services

It is not permitted to provide commercial services from your account on our systems. 

## Impairing Other Users

On nodes intended for shared use to access a service ("login nodes"), we run a system intended to restrict the load any single user can produce.

We may also terminate running processes, or remove running or queued jobs, if they impair the availability of shared resources for other users.


## Access Suspension

If you:

 - are subject to a UCL disciplinary procedure,
 - or breach UCL's Computing Regulations,
 - or are suspected to have shared your access credentials,
 - or are suspected to be involved in a security incident,

we may raise this with relevant UCL teams[^fn-isg] and suspend your access to services until any relevant processes have been completed.

[^fn-isg]: I.e. the Information Security Group, or Human Resources.


## Your Data

DSH have data storage capabilities, but should not be treated as the sole repository for your data. We do not do back-up of the data.
Outages and data-loss events will be handled on a best-efforts basis within normal UCL working hours.

### Transferring Data Ownership

You may contact us to arrange to transfer ownership of your data on a service to another user, with their consent. Please arrange this before you stop being a user.

### Data Access by Support Staff

We will not access your data without your consent under any circumstances.

### Data Retention


#### Data Retention on Leaving UCL

We intend to retain user data for 180 days after a user has either left UCL, requested that their account be removed, had their institution request that their account be removed, or become ineligible for an account in some other way.

This process is not currently automated, so data may still be retained after this time. Please contact us if you need to ensure your data has been erased.

#### Backup Retention

- Our cluster do not do back up of any data.

## Acknowledgement in Works
