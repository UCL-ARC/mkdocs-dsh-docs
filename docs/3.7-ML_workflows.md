# Example machine learning workflow

Below is an example workflow for using the DSH HPC Cluster to perform machine learning using a cluster GPU.

For many ML workflows, we use Conda environments to simplify setup and reproducibility (see our [Installing Software](https://github-pages.arc.ucl.ac.uk/mkdocs-dsh-docs/3.1-Installing_Software/?h=conda#create-a-virtualenv-using-conda) page for more details).

Where possible, for each new project we recommend building a new environment from scratch, then gradually adding functionality to it as you scale up your testing (i.e. start with making an environment that can see and use GPU, then add ML libraries and test, and finally start debugging your ML code). In the DSH Research Compute environment, GPU libraries like CUDA are pre-installed on relevant machines and accessible for all users (i.e., we don't need to load their software modules), so all we have to do is install software that utilises these GPUs' libraries. 

!!! Note 
    The DSH HPC Cluster's login nodes do not have GPU capability -- to properly test a GPU-dependent environment in the cluster, you will need to request an interactive session using `qlogin`/`qrsh`, or submit a test job using the `-l gpu` option.

As an example, the commands below can be used to create a Conda environment that provides PyTorch with CUDA capability.

First we'll create a new Conda environment called `gpu-env`, install `python` and `pip` in it, and activate:
```
conda create --name gpu-env python=3.10 pip
conda activate gpu-env
```
*(If you have not used Conda before, it may get you to run `conda init` once at the start, which is expected — you'll then need to restart the shell for changes to take effect)*

Once the new "gpu-env" is activated you should see your command line prompt begin with something like `(gpu-env) username@hostname`, which tells you it's working as expected.

Next we'll use `pip` to install `torch` and other libraries (though you could be using `conda install` instead -- just note that some package names differ between `conda` and `pip`).
```
pip install torch pandas numpy
```
Once the new `gpu-env` has `torch` installed, you can create a new test script with `nano ~/<yourfolder>/test.py`, and then add the following lines:


    > test.py
    
    import torch
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
 
    print(f"Torch version: {torch.__version__}")
    print(f"Torch cuda is available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
    print(f"Torch cuda device count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
 
    x = torch.rand(5, 3)
    print(x)
    

To run your script as a test job:
- create an example script (e.g. `nano gpu-test-run.sh`)
- add the lines shown below (making sure to revise `<yourusername>` and paths to `<yourfolder>` with python script)
- Once saved, submit it with `qsub gpu-test-run.sh`

```
> gpu-test-run.sh

 #!/bin/bash -l
 
 # job name
 #$ -N gpu-test-run
 
 # set RAM (increase after testing)
 #$ -l h_vmem=16G
 
 # request 1 GPU
 #$ -l gpu=1
 
 # Request ten minutes compute time (h:m:s)
 #$ -l h_rt=0:10:0
 
 # Set the working directory to where you saved your test.py script
 #$ -wd /hpchome/<yourusername>.IDHS.UCL.AC.UK/<yourfolder>
 
 # activate the conda gpu environment
 conda activate gpu-env
 
 # run the test script
 python test.py
```
Lastly, it's also worth mentioning that you can do a lot of testing/debugging with interactive jobs, which you can request on a gpu node with `qlogin -l gpu`. This interactive job should let you run sanity checks like `nvidia-smi`, which gives you gpu card info if one is available, and test basic functionality of your `gpu-env` environment before you run jobs with it.
