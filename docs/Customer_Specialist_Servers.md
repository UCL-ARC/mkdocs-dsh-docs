# Customer Specialist Servers.

You can request your own server to carry on you work. Note that Only a project's Information Asset Owner (IAO) or Information Asset Administrator (IAA) can request creation of a standalone Customer Specialist Server.
We ask that you provide us with a MINIMUM set of requirements because resources are limited and must be shared based on need, so if you ask for too much there is a much higher chance that your request will be rejected outright.
The standard Customer Specialist Server is a fairly barebones Linux RedHat 8 virtual machine with above-average hardware specs.

Customer Specialist Servers will have access to the DSH Artifactory, so many software packages will be self-installable. However, most other software that is provided in the DSH may not necessarily be installed by default, so if you have particular software or configuration requirements please be sure to specify these in as much detail as you are able.

## Requesting a Customer Specialist Server

Our configurations are always completely dependent on the needs of the user -- we will work together to figure out what you need, and then our team will put it together for you. To do this, we broadly need to determine four things:
  
1. what hardware you need -- specifically, CPU, RAM, storage, and GPUs (if any)
2. what software you need
3. how long you need to use it
4. what sort of configuration environment you want us to create for you (optional)

To request a Customer Specialist Server be created, please get the project's IAO or IAA to create a [Data Safe Haven - General DSH Enquiry in MyServices](https://myservices.ucl.ac.uk/self-service/requests/new/provide_description?from=wizard&requested_for_id=187535&requestor_id=187535&service_id=1473&service_instance_id=3892&subject=Data+Safe+Haven+-+General+DSH+Enquiry%3A&template_id=3222), and mention that you want a "Custom Specialist Server", along with the following information:

- Your project's five-digit CaseRef number.
- Answers to the following questions, where applicable:
    - Do you have specific minimum Storage, CPU, or RAM requirements? Do you require any other hardware?
    - Do you require any specialty software to be installed (e.g. JupyterLab, Rstudio, etc.)?
    - Do you have any other specific configuration or operational needs that we should be aware of?
    - What is the timeline for your study, and how long do you expect to require these computing resources (if these timelines differ)?
