# How this repository works:

This repository uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme to build and deploy documentation as a static website.

- All documentation source files are located in the top-level `/docs` directory.
- The site is automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions, with the workflow file located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- On every push to the `main` branch, the workflow installs MkDocs Material, builds the site, and publishes the output to the `gh-pages` branch.
- GitHub Pages is configured to serve the site from the `gh-pages` branch.
- To update to the site, just edit the markdown files in `/docs`, commit and push to have your changes take effect in the site re-build.
